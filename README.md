# 👋 Hello, I’m Lovlesh Pokra

 As a seasoned developer, I specialize in crafting robust web and mobile applications at scale. My passion lies in pushing the boundaries of JavaScript, whether it’s on the front-end, back-end, or in hybrid environments.

**💼 Industry Experience**

With over 9 years of industry experience, I’ve navigated the startup landscape and collaborated with large corporations. My expertise extends beyond code—I’ve led engineering teams, overseen projects from inception to production, and conducted insightful A/B tests.

**🖥️ Tech Toolbox**
In my day-to-day work, I wield an array of tools: **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Algorithms, Data Structures, Salesforce (Apex/VF/LWC), AWS (Lambda/CICD), Docker, Apache Cordova, CSS3, HTML5, Progressive Web Apps, Webpack, GitHub, and Jira sometimes Angular, Vue.js as well. Not limited to just these.

**🚀 Passion Projects**
I’m perpetually curious. Whether it’s diving into accessibility, fine-tuning performance, or fearlessly debugging my code, I thrive on challenges. Collaboration fuels my creativity, and breaking barriers is my modus operandi.

**🌱 Learning Journey**
Currently, I’m immersing myself in cloud platforms—specifically AWS and Salesforce. The sky’s the limit, and I’m reaching for the clouds!
